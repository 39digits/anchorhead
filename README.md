# Anchorhead

An opinionated set of install scripts to bootstrap a fresh Ubuntu install into a full armed and operational development station.

The install favours the light side and as such even the Terminal and NeoVim themes are light.

## Compatibility

The install scripts have been tested on Ubuntu 24.04, 24.10, and 25.04.

## Credits

Heavily inspired by Omakub.
